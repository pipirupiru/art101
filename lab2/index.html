				<h1>Kiki Log</h1>
					<p> My name is Kiki, I don't have much to say about myself. I am graduated from UCSC.
						I am working in one of the many research labs on campus. I am not really digging the job,
						but I am very grateful for the opportunity to work here. I still have a lot of searching to do
						before settling down with a job. Right now, my goal is to go back to school in LA and really look 
						for what motivates me in my life. 
				</p>

				<h2>Current Interests</h2>
				<p> I've haven't been doing much of anything recently. I've been very tired
					at the end of each day, so I barely have time to really engage with my hobbies,
					let alone myself. But I've been making a conscious effort to do other things besides sleep.
					I've been practicing bass guitar. Often I try to dress up in my personal style and play with my apperence.
					When I have the energy, I play pool. I think I am not half bad. I have been reading a bit more. 
					I play on my Nintendo DS a lot.
					I haven't been drawing as much as I want to do, but I think that I've just been tired of the medium.
					I want to do something more engaging, but I am not sure what yet. I love working on my cosplays, but I haven't
					had the chance to do anything with that. So basically a lot of daydreaming jajaja.
